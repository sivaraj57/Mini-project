 <h1>Linked List Data Structure</h1>
   
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each of which contains a reference (or link) to the next element in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size and can efficiently insert or delete elements at any position within the list.</p>

    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>A linked list is composed of nodes. Each node has two components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data:</strong> The actual data or value stored in the node.</li>
        <li><strong>Pointer (or Link):</strong> A reference to the next node in the sequence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first node is called the "head," and the last node typically points to a null reference, indicating the end of the list.</p>

    <h2>Types of Linked Lists</h2>
    <p>There are different types of linked lists, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Singly Linked List:</strong> Each node contains a data element and a reference to the next node.</li>
        <li><strong>Doubly Linked List:</strong> Each node contains a data element, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node, allowing for traversal in both directions.</li>
        <li><strong>Circular Linked List:</strong> A variation of a singly or doubly linked list where the last node points back to the first node, creating a closed loop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Operations</h2>
    <p>Operations performed on linked lists include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Insertion:</strong> Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or any position within the list.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Removing a node from the list, which involves updating the references of neighboring nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Traversal:</strong> Iterating through the linked list to access or process each element.</li>
        <li><strong>Search:</strong> Finding a specific element within the linked list.</li>
        <li><strong>Reversal:</strong> Changing the order of elements by reversing the direction of links.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Here's a simple example in Python that demonstrates the use of a singly linked list:</p>

    <pre>
<code>
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        current = self.head
        while current.next:
            current = current.next
        current.next = new_node

# Creating a linked list
my_list = LinkedList()
my_list.append(1)
my_list.append(2)
my_list.append(3)
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Linked lists are versatile data structures that provide efficient dynamic storage and easy insertion and deletion of elements. They are used in various applications, including implementing dynamic data structures like stacks, queues, and symbol tables.</p>

    <p>Understanding linked lists is fundamental for data structure and algorithm study and for solving problems that require dynamic data management.</p>

    <h1>Types of Linked Lists</h1>
   
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A linked list is a linear data structure composed of nodes, where each node stores a data element and a reference (or link) to the next node. Linked lists come in various forms, each tailored to specific use cases or requirements. Here, we'll explore different types of linked lists.</p>

    <h2>Singly Linked List</h2>
    <p>In a singly linked list, each node contains a data element and a reference to the next node in the sequence. It is called "singly" because there is only one link between each node, pointing forward. Singly linked lists are commonly used for their simplicity and efficient insertion and deletion operations.</p>

    <h2>Doubly Linked List</h2>
    <p>A doubly linked list extends the concept of a singly linked list by including a reference to the previous node in each node, allowing for bidirectional traversal. In addition to the next reference, each node contains a previous reference. Doubly linked lists are suitable for operations requiring backward traversal, such as implementing text editors or browsers with "Back" and "Forward" functionality.</p>

    <h2>Circular Linked List</h2>
    <p>A circular linked list is a variation of a singly or doubly linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a closed loop. Circular linked lists are useful in situations where elements need to be continuously cycled or when you want to create a circular buffer with a fixed size.</p>

    <h2>Types of Operations</h2>
    <p>Common operations on linked lists include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Insertion:</strong> Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or any position within the list.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Removing a node from the list, which involves updating the references of neighboring nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Traversal:</strong> Iterating through the linked list to access or process each element.</li>
        <li><strong>Search:</strong> Finding a specific element within the linked list.</li>
        <li><strong>Reversal:</strong> Changing the order of elements by reversing the direction of links.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Here's a simple example in Python that demonstrates the use of a singly linked list:</p>

    <pre>
<code>
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        current = self.head
        while current.next:
            current = current.next
        current.next = new_node

# Creating a singly linked list
my_list = LinkedList()
my_list.append(1)
my_list.append(2)
my_list.append(3)
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Linked lists, in their various forms, provide flexibility in handling data and are used in a wide range of applications. Understanding the differences and characteristics of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists is essential for choosing the right data structure for specific programming tasks.</p>

    <p>Each type of linked list has its advantages and disadvantages, making them suitable for different scenarios.</p>

   <h1>Singly Linked List Data Structure</h1>
   
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A singly linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements called nodes. Each node contains two components: data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This "singly" linked structure means that you can traverse the list in only one direction, from the head (the first node) to the tail (the last node).</p>

    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>A singly linked list is composed of nodes, and each node has two parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data:</strong> The actual data or value stored in the node.</li>
        <li><strong>Next Reference (Link):</strong> A reference to the next node in the list. The last node typically points to a null reference, indicating the end of the list.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Operations</h2>
    <p>Operations performed on singly linked lists include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Insertion:</strong> Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or any position within the list.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Removing a node from the list, which involves updating the references of neighboring nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Traversal:</strong> Iterating through the linked list to access or process each element.</li>
        <li><strong>Search:</strong> Finding a specific element within the linked list.</li>
        <li><strong>Reversal:</strong> Changing the order of elements by reversing the direction of links.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Here's a simple example in Python that demonstrates the use of a singly linked list:</p>

    <pre>
<code>
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class SinglyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        current = self.head
        while current.next:
            current = current.next
        current.next = new_node

# Creating a singly linked list
my_list = SinglyLinkedList()
my_list.append(1)
my_list.append(2)
my_list.append(3)
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Singly linked lists are versatile data structures that provide efficient dynamic storage and easy insertion and deletion of elements. They are used in various applications, including implementing dynamic data structures like stacks and queues and solving problems that require singly linked structures.</p>

    <p>Understanding singly linked lists and their operations is fundamental for data structure and algorithm study and for solving problems that involve one-way traversal of data.</p>

 <h1>Doubly Linked List Data Structure</h1>
   
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A doubly linked list is a linear data structure that extends the concept of a singly linked list by including two references (or links) in each node: one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node. This bidirectional structure allows for traversal in both forward and backward directions.</p>

    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>A doubly linked list is composed of nodes, and each node has three parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data:</strong> The actual data or value stored in the node.</li>
        <li><strong>Next Reference (Link):</strong> A reference to the next node in the list.</li>
        <li><strong>Previous Reference (Link):</strong> A reference to the previous node in the list.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Operations</h2>
    <p>Operations performed on doubly linked lists include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Insertion:</strong> Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or any position within the list.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Removing a node from the list, which involves updating the references of neighboring nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Forward Traversal:</strong> Iterating through the linked list in the forward direction to access or process each element.</li>
        <li><strong>Backward Traversal:</strong> Iterating through the linked list in the backward direction to access or process each element.</li>
        <li><strong>Search:</strong> Finding a specific element within the linked list.</li>
        <li><strong>Reversal:</strong> Changing the order of elements by reversing the direction of links.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Here's a simple example in Python that demonstrates the use of a doubly linked list:</p>

    <pre>
<code>
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None

class DoublyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        current = self.head
        while current.next:
            current = current.next
        current.next = new_node
        new_node.prev = current

# Creating a doubly linked list
my_list = DoublyLinkedList()
my_list.append(1)
my_list.append(2)
my_list.append(3)
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Doubly linked lists provide flexibility in handling data with bidirectional traversal capabilities. They are used in various applications, including implementing text editors, browsers with "Back" and "Forward" functionality, and situations where efficient backward traversal is required.</p>

    <p>Understanding doubly linked lists and their operations is fundamental for data structure and algorithm study and for solving problems that involve bidirectional data traversal.</p>

    <h1>Circular Linked List Data Structure</h1>
   
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A circular linked list is a variation of a singly linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a closed loop. In other words, the tail of the list connects to the head, creating a continuous cycle. Circular linked lists are used in various applications where continuous traversal or cycling through elements is needed.</p>

    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>A circular linked list is composed of nodes, similar to a singly linked list, with each node containing two parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data:</strong> The actual data or value stored in the node.</li>
        <li><strong>Next Reference (Link):</strong> A reference to the next node in the list. The last node points back to the first node, creating the circular structure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Operations</h2>
    <p>Operations performed on circular linked lists include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Insertion:</strong> Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or any position within the list.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Removing a node from the list, which involves updating the references of neighboring nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Traversal:</strong> Iterating through the linked list to access or process each element, which continues indefinitely due to the circular structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Search:</strong> Finding a specific element within the linked list.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Here's a simple example in Python that demonstrates the use of a circular linked list:</p>

    <pre>
<code>

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            self.head.next = self.head  # Point back to itself to create the circular structure
            return
        current = self.head
        while current.next != self.head:
            current = current.next
        current.next = new_node
        new_node.next = self.head

# Creating a circular linked list
my_list = CircularLinkedList()
my_list.append(1)
my_list.append(2)
my_list.append(3)
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Circular linked lists provide a unique data structure with continuous traversal capabilities. They are used in various applications, including implementing circular buffers, managing tasks in a round-robin scheduling algorithm, and representing cyclical data.</p>

    <p>Understanding circular linked lists and their operations is important for data structure and algorithm study and for solving problems that involve cyclic data structures.</p>

    <h1><span class="color_h1">Distributed in OS</span></h1>
    <p>In this chapter, you begin to learn with an examination of some of the primary concepts in distributed software which includes client - server architecture, message passing technique, and remote procedure calls. Then you will examine the increasingly significant cluster architecture.</p>

    <h2>What is Client-Server Computing</h2>
    <p>As with other developing phases of the computer field, the client/server computing comes with its new collection of terminologies. As the term depicts, a client/server environment is occupied by clients and servers. The client systems are generally single - user workstations or computers which provide a highly user-friendly interface for the end-user.

        <br><br>The client based station usually presents the type of graphical interface (GUI) which is most comfortable to users that include the requirement of windows and a mouse. Microsoft Windows and Mac OS offers an example of those types of interfaces. Client-based applications are customized for simplicity in using and include familiar tools like a spreadsheet. Every server in the client/server environment allows a set of shared services for the clients. The most common category of the server at present used is the database servers.

    <h2>Distributed Client/Server Architecture's Terminologies</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Applications Programming Interface (API): </b>It is a set of task, and it calls programs which allow clients as well as servers for intercommunicating with each other.</li>
        <li><b>Client / User: </b>It is a networked information requester which is typically a computer system or workstation which can query database and / or other information from a server.</li>
        <li><b>Middleware: </b>It is a set of drivers, API's and / or other software which improves the connection among a client application with a server.</li>
        <li><b>Relational Database: </b>It is a type of database wherein the information access becomes limited to the selection of rows which satisfy all search criteria.</li>
        <li><b>Server: </b>It is also a computer, typically a high-powered systems and workstations or a minicomputer or a mainframe, which houses information to manipulate the networked clients.</li>
        <li><b>Structured Query Language (SQL): </b>It is a language developed by IBM (International Business Machines) and ANSI had standardized it for addressing, producing, updating and querying RDB's (relational databases).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Distributed Message Passing</h2>
    <p>It is generally the case in any distributed processing structures/systems where the computers don't share main memory instead each of them is an isolated computer system. Thus, inter-processor communication mechanisms which rely on shared memory, such as semaphores, can't be used. Hence, techniques which depend on message passing are used.

        <br><br>The 1st one is the straightforward application for messages as they are utilized in a single system. The 2nd follows a separate technique which relies on message passing as a essential function which is the remote procedure call.
    </p>

    <h2>Clusters in Distributed Systems</h2>
    <p>Clustering is a substitute to symmetric multiprocessing as it is another way of providing high performance and availability which is particularly attractive for server applications. You can define a cluster as a collection of interconnected, complete computers working together as a combined computing resource which can create the structure of being one machine. The term complete computer tells that a system can run on its own, separately from the cluster and, each computer in the cluster is usually referred to as a node.</p>

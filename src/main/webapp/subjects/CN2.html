<p>Today’s world is an information-rich world and it has become a necessity for everyone to know about computers. A computer is an electronic data processing device, which accepts and stores data input, processes the data input, and generates the output in a required format.</p>
<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to Computers and its fundamentals.</p>
<h2>Functionalities of a Computer</h2>
<p>If we look at it in a very broad sense, any digital computer carries out the following five functions −</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> − Takes data as input.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> − Stores the data/instructions in its memory and uses them as required.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> − Processes the data and converts it into useful information.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> − Generates the output.</p>
<p><b>Step 5</b> − Controls all the above four steps.</p>

   <h2>Bar Code Readers</h2>
   <p>Bar Code Reader is a device used for reading bar coded data (data in the form of light and dark lines). Bar coded data is generally used in labelling goods, numbering the books, etc. It may be a handheld scanner or may be embedded in a stationary scanner.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/barcode_reader.jpg" alt="Barcode Reader">
   <p>Bar Code Reader scans a bar code image, converts it into an alphanumeric value, which is then fed to the computer that the bar code reader is connected to.</p>
   <h2>Optical Mark Reader (OMR)</h2>
   <p>OMR is a special type of optical scanner used to recognize the type of mark made by pen or pencil. It is used where one out of a few alternatives is to be selected and marked.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/omr.jpg" alt="Optical Mark Reader(OMR)">
   <p>It is specially used for checking the answer sheets of examinations having multiple choice questions.</p>
   <p>Following are some of the important output devices used in a computer.</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>Monitors</li>
   <li>Graphic Plotter</li>
   <li>Printer</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Monitors</h2>
   <p>Monitors, commonly called as <b>Visual Display Unit</b> (VDU), are the main output device of a computer. It forms images from tiny dots, called pixels that are arranged in a rectangular form. The sharpness of the image depends upon the number of pixels.</p>
   <p>There are two kinds of viewing screen used for monitors.</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT)</li>
   <li>Flat-Panel Display</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) Monitor</h3>
   <p>The CRT display is made up of small picture elements called pixels. The smaller the pixels, the better the image clarity or resolution. It takes more than one illuminated pixel to form a whole character, such as the letter ‘e’ in the word help.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/crt_monitor.jpg" alt="CRT Monitor">
   <p>A finite number of characters can be displayed on a screen at once. The screen can be divided into a series of character boxes - fixed location on the screen where a standard character can be placed. Most screens are capable of displaying 80 characters of data horizontally and 25 lines vertically.</p>
   <p>There are some disadvantages of CRT −</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>Large in Size</li>
   <li>High power consumption</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Flat-Panel Display Monitor</h3>
   <p>The flat-panel display refers to a class of video devices that have reduced volume, weight and power requirement in comparison to the CRT. You can hang them on walls or wear them on your wrists. Current uses of flat-panel displays include calculators, video games, monitors, laptop computer, and graphics display.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/flat_monitor.jpg" alt="Flat Monitor">
   <p>The flat-panel display is divided into two categories −</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li><p><b>Emissive Displays</b> − Emissive displays are devices that convert electrical energy into light. For example, plasma panel and LED (Light-Emitting Diodes).</p></li>
   <li><p><b>Non-Emissive Displays</b> − Non-emissive displays use optical effects to convert sunlight or light from some other source into graphics patterns. For example, LCD (Liquid-Crystal Device).</p></li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Printers</h2>
   <p>Printer is an output device, which is used to print information on paper.</p>

   <p>These are of two types −</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>Drum Printer</li>
   <li>Chain Printer</li>
   </ul>
   <p><b>Drum Printer</b></p>
   <p>This printer is like a drum in shape hence it is called drum printer. The surface of the drum is divided into a number of tracks. Total tracks are equal to the size of the paper, i.e. for a paper width of 132 characters, drum will have 132 tracks. A character set is embossed on the track. Different character sets available in the market are 48 character set, 64 and 96 characters set. One rotation of drum prints one line. Drum printers are fast in speed and can print 300 to 2000 lines per minute.</p>

   <p>A memory is just like a human brain. It is used to store data and instructions. Computer memory is the storage space in the computer, where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored. The memory is divided into large number of small parts called cells. Each location or cell has a unique address, which varies from zero to memory size minus one. For example, if the computer has 64k words, then this memory unit has 64 * 1024 = 65536 memory locations. The address of these locations varies from 0 to 65535.</p>
   <p>Memory is primarily of three types −</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>Cache Memory</li>
   <li>Primary Memory/Main Memory</li>
   <li>Secondary Memory</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Cache Memory</h2>
   <p>Cache memory is a very high speed semiconductor memory which can speed up the CPU. It acts as a buffer between the CPU and the main memory. It is used to hold those parts of data and program which are most frequently used by the CPU. The parts of data and programs are transferred from the disk to cache memory by the operating system, from where the CPU can access them.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/cache_memory.jpg" alt="Cache Memory">
   <h3>Advantages</h3>
   <p>The advantages of cache memory are as follows −</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>Cache memory is faster than main memory.</li>
   <li>It consumes less access time as compared to main memory.</li>
   <li>It stores the program that can be executed within a short period of time.</li>
   <li>It stores data for temporary use.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
   <p>The disadvantages of cache memory are as follows −</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>Cache memory has limited capacity.</li>
   <li>It is very expensive.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Primary Memory (Main Memory)</h2>
   <p>Primary memory holds only those data and instructions on which the computer is currently working. It has a limited capacity and data is lost when power is switched off. It is generally made up of semiconductor device. These memories are not as fast as registers. The data and instruction required to be processed resides in the main memory. It is divided into two subcategories RAM and ROM.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/primary_memory.jpg" alt="Primary Memory">
   <h3>Characteristics of Main Memory</h3>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>These are semiconductor memories.</li>
   <li>It is known as the main memory.</li>
   <li>Usually volatile memory.</li>
   <li>Data is lost in case power is switched off.</li>
   <li>It is the working memory of the computer.</li>
   <li>Faster than secondary memories.</li>
   <li>A computer cannot run without the primary memory.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Secondary Memory</h2>
   <p>This type of memory is also known as external memory or non-volatile. It is slower than the main memory. These are used for storing data/information permanently. CPU directly does not access these memories, instead they are accessed via input-output routines. The contents of secondary memories are first transferred to the main memory, and then the CPU can access it. For example, disk, CD-ROM, DVD, etc.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/secondary_memory.jpg" alt="Secondar Memory">
   <h3>Characteristics of Secondary Memory</h3>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>These are magnetic and optical memories.</li>
   <li>It is known as the backup memory.</li>
   <li>It is a non-volatile memory.</li>
   <li>Data is permanently stored even if power is switched off.</li>
   <li>It is used for storage of data in a computer.</li>
   <li>Computer may run without the secondary memory.</li>
   <li>Slower than primary memories.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is the internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program, and program result. It is a read/write memory which stores data until the machine is working. As soon as the machine is switched off, data is erased.</p>
   <img class="raligned" src="/computer_fundamentals/images/primary_memory.jpg" alt="Primary Memory">
   <p>Access time in RAM is independent of the address, that is, each storage location inside the memory is as easy to reach as other locations and takes the same amount of time. Data in the RAM can be accessed randomly but it is very expensive.</p>
   <p>RAM is volatile, i.e. data stored in it is lost when we switch off the computer or if there is a power failure. Hence, a backup Uninterruptible Power System (UPS) is often used with computers. RAM is small, both in terms of its physical size and in the amount of data it can hold.</p>
   <p>RAM is of two types −</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>Static RAM (SRAM)</li>
   <li>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Static RAM (SRAM)</h2>
   <p>The word <b>static</b> indicates that the memory retains its contents as long as power is being supplied. However, data is lost when the power gets down due to volatile nature. SRAM chips use a matrix of 6-transistors and no capacitors. Transistors do not require power to prevent leakage, so SRAM need not be refreshed on a regular basis.</p>
   <p>There is extra space in the matrix, hence SRAM uses more chips than DRAM for the same amount of storage space, making the manufacturing costs higher. SRAM is thus used as cache memory and has very fast access.</p>
   <h3>Characteristic of Static RAM</h3>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>Long life</li>
   <li>No need to refresh</li>
   <li>Faster</li>
   <li>Used as cache memory</li>
   <li>Large size</li>
   <li>Expensive</li>
   <li>High power consumption</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</h2>
   <p>DRAM, unlike SRAM, must be continually <b>refreshed</b> in order to maintain the data. This is done by placing the memory on a refresh circuit that rewrites the data several hundred times per second. DRAM is used for most system memory as it is cheap and small. All DRAMs are made up of memory cells, which are composed of one capacitor and one transistor.</p>
   <h3>Characteristics of Dynamic RAM</h3>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>Short data lifetime</li>
   <li>Needs to be refreshed continuously</li>
   <li>Slower as compared to SRAM</li>
   <li>Used as RAM</li>
   <li>Smaller in size</li>
   <li>Less expensive</li>
   <li>Less power consumption</li>
   </ul>
   <p>ROM stands for <b>Read Only Memory</b>. The memory from which we can only read but cannot write on it. This type of memory is non-volatile. The information is stored permanently in such memories during manufacture. A ROM stores such instructions that are required to start a computer. This operation is referred to as <b>bootstrap</b>. ROM chips are not only used in the computer but also in other electronic items like washing machine and microwave oven.</p>
<img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/rom.jpg" alt="ROM">
<p>Let us now discuss the various types of ROMs and their characteristics.</p>
<h2>MROM (Masked ROM)</h2>
<p>The very first ROMs were hard-wired devices that contained a pre-programmed set of data or instructions. These kind of ROMs are known as masked ROMs, which are inexpensive.</p>
<h2>PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory)</h2>
<p>PROM is read-only memory that can be modified only once by a user. The user buys a blank PROM and enters the desired contents using a PROM program. Inside the PROM chip, there are small fuses which are burnt open during programming. It can be programmed only once and is not erasable.</p>
<h2>EPROM (Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory)</h2>
<p>EPROM can be erased by exposing it to ultra-violet light for a duration of up to 40 minutes. Usually, an EPROM eraser achieves this function. During programming, an electrical charge is trapped in an insulated gate region. The charge is retained for more than 10 years because the charge has no leakage path. For erasing this charge, ultra-violet light is passed through a quartz crystal window (lid). This exposure to ultra-violet light dissipates the charge. During normal use, the quartz lid is sealed with a sticker.</p>
<h2>EEPROM (Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory)</h2>
<p>EEPROM is programmed and erased electrically. It can be erased and reprogrammed about ten thousand times. Both erasing and programming take about 4 to 10 ms (millisecond). In EEPROM, any location can be selectively erased and programmed. EEPROMs can be erased one byte at a time, rather than erasing the entire chip. Hence, the process of reprogramming is flexible but slow.</p>
<h2>Advantages of ROM</h2>
<p>The advantages of ROM are as follows −</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Non-volatile in nature</li>
<li>Cannot be accidentally changed</li>
<li>Cheaper than RAMs</li>
<li>Easy to test</li>
<li>More reliable than RAMs</li>
<li>Static and do not require refreshing</li>
<li>Contents are always known and can be verified</li>
</ul>

   <h2>Relationship between Hardware and Software</h2>
   <ul class="list">
   <li><p>Hardware and software are mutually dependent on each other. Both of them must work together to make a computer produce a useful output.</p></li>
   <li><p>Software cannot be utilized without supporting hardware.</p></li>
   <li><p>Hardware without a set of programs to operate upon cannot be utilized and is useless.</p></li>
   <li><p>To get a particular job done on the computer, relevant software should be loaded into the hardware.</p></li>
   <li><p>Hardware is a one-time expense.</p></li>
   <li><p>Software development is very expensive and is a continuing expense.</p></li>
   <li><p>Different software applications can be loaded on a hardware to run different jobs.</p></li>
   <li><p>A software acts as an interface between the user and the hardware.</p></li>
   <li><p>If the hardware is the 'heart' of a computer system, then the software is its 'soul'. Both are complementary to each other.</p></li>
   </ul>
   <p>Software is a set of programs, which is designed to perform a well-defined function. A program is a sequence of instructions written to solve a particular problem.</p>
   <p>There are two types of software −</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>System Software</li>
   <li>Application Software</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>System Software</h2>
   <p>The system software is a collection of programs designed to operate, control, and extend the processing capabilities of the computer itself. System software is generally prepared by the computer manufacturers. These software products comprise of programs written in low-level languages, which interact with the hardware at a very basic level. System software serves as the interface between the hardware and the end users.</p>
   <p>Some examples of system software are Operating System, Compilers, Interpreter, Assemblers, etc.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/system_software.jpg" alt="Application Software">
   <p>Here is a list of some of the most prominent features of a system software −</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>Close to the system</li>
   <li>Fast in speed</li>
   <li>Difficult to design</li>
   <li>Difficult to understand</li>
   <li>Less interactive</li>
   <li>Smaller in size</li>
   <li>Difficult to manipulate</li>
   <li>Generally written in low-level language</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Application Software</h2>
   <p>Application software products are designed to satisfy a particular need of a particular environment. All software applications prepared in the computer lab can come under the category of Application software.</p>
   <p>Application software may consist of a single program, such as Microsoft's notepad for writing and editing a simple text. It may also consist of a collection of programs, often called a software package, which work together to accomplish a task, such as a spreadsheet package.</p>
   <p>Examples of Application software are the following −</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>Payroll Software</li>
   <li>Student Record Software</li>
   <li>Inventory Management Software</li>
   <li>Income Tax Software</li>
   <li>Railways Reservation Software</li>
   <li>Microsoft Office Suite Software</li>
   <li>Microsoft Word</li>
   <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
   <li>Microsoft PowerPoint</li>
   </ul>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/application_software.jpg" alt="Application Software">
   <p>Features of application software are as follows −</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>Close to the user</li>
   <li>Easy to design</li>
   <li>More interactive</li>
   <li>Slow in speed</li>
   <li>Generally written in high-level language</li>
   <li>Easy to understand</li>
   <li>Easy to manipulate and use</li>
   <li>Bigger in size and requires large storage space</li>
   </ul>
   <p>When we type some letters or words, the computer translates them in numbers as computers can understand only numbers. A computer can understand the positional number system where there are only a few symbols called digits and these symbols represent different values depending on the position they occupy in the number.</p>
   <p>The value of each digit in a number can be determined using −</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li><p>The digit</p></li>
   <li><p>The position of the digit in the number</p></li>
   <li><p>The base of the number system (where the base is defined as the total number of digits available in the number system)</p></li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Decimal Number System</h2>
   <p>The number system that we use in our day-to-day life is the decimal number system. Decimal number system has base 10 as it uses 10 digits from 0 to 9. In decimal number system, the successive positions to the left of the decimal point represent units, tens, hundreds, thousands, and so on.</p>
   <p>Each position represents a specific power of the base (10). For example, the decimal number 1234 consists of the digit 4 in the units position, 3 in the tens position, 2 in the hundreds position, and 1 in the thousands position. Its value can be written as</p>
   <pre class="result notranslate">(1 x 1000)+ (2 x 100)+ (3 x 10)+ (4 x l)
   (1 x 10<sup>3</sup>)+ (2 x 10<sup>2</sup>)+ (3 x 10<sup>1</sup>)+ (4 x l0<sup>0</sup>)
   1000 + 200 + 30 + 4
   1234
   </pre>
   <p>As a computer programmer or an IT professional, you should understand the following number systems which are frequently used in computers.</p>

   <p>There are many methods or techniques which can be used to convert numbers from one base to another. In this chapter, we'll demonstrate the following −</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>Decimal to Other Base System</li>

   <li>Shortcut method - Binary to Hexadecimal</li>
   <li>Shortcut method - Hexadecimal to Binary</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Decimal to Other Base System</h2>
   <p><b>Step 1</b> − Divide the decimal number to be converted by the value of the new base.</p>
   <p><b>Step 2</b> − Get the remainder from Step 1 as the rightmost digit (least significant digit) of the new base number.</p>
   <p><b>Step 3</b> − Divide the quotient of the previous divide by the new base.</p>
   <p><b>Step 4</b> − Record the remainder from Step 3 as the next digit (to the left) of the new base number.</p>
   <p>Repeat Steps 3 and 4, getting remainders from right to left, until the quotient becomes zero in Step 3.</p>
   <p>The last remainder thus obtained will be the Most Significant Digit (MSD) of the new base number.</p>

   <p><b>Data</b> can be defined as a representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner, which should be suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing by human or electronic machine.</p>
   <p>Data is represented with the help of characters such as alphabets (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9) or special characters (+,-,/,*,&lt;,&gt;,= etc.)</p>
   <h2>What is Information?</h2>
   <p><b>Information</b> is organized or classified data, which has some meaningful values for the receiver. Information is the processed data on which decisions and actions are based.</p>
   <p>For the decision to be meaningful, the processed data must qualify for the following characteristics −</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li><p><b>Timely</b> − Information should be available when required.</p></li>
   <li><p><b>Accuracy</b> − Information should be accurate.</p></li>
   <li><p><b>Completeness</b> − Information should be complete.</p></li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Data Processing Cycle</h2>
   <p>Data processing is the re-structuring or re-ordering of data by people or machine to increase their usefulness and add values for a particular purpose. Data processing consists of the following basic steps - input, processing, and output. These three steps constitute the data processing cycle.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/computer_data.jpg" alt="Computer Data">
   <ul class="list">
   <li><p><b>Input</b> − In this step, the input data is prepared in some convenient form for processing. The form will depend on the processing machine. For example, when electronic computers are used, the input data can be recorded on any one of the several types of input medium, such as magnetic disks, tapes, and so on.</p></li>
   <li><p><b>Processing</b> − In this step, the input data is changed to produce data in a more useful form. For example, pay-checks can be calculated from the time cards, or a summary of sales for the month can be calculated from the sales orders.</p></li>
   <li><p><b>Output</b> − At this stage, the result of the proceeding processing step is collected. The particular form of the output data depends on the use of the data. For example, output data may be pay-checks for employees.</p></li>
   </ul>
   <p>A <b>computer network</b> is a system in which multiple computers are connected to each other to share information and resources.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/computer_networks.jpg" alt="Computer Networks">
   <h2>Characteristics of a Computer Network</h2>
   <ul class="list">
   <li><p>Share resources from one computer to another.</p></li>
   <li><p>Create files and store them in one computer, access those files from the other computer(s) connected over the network.</p></li>
   <li><p>Connect a printer, scanner, or a fax machine to one computer within the network and let other computers of the network use the machines available over the network.</p></li>
   </ul>
   <p>Following is the list of hardware's required to set up a computer network.</p>
   <ul class="list">
   <li>Network Cables</li>
   <li>Distributors</li>
   <li>Routers</li>
   <li>Internal Network Cards</li>
   <li>External Network Cards</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Network Cables</h2>
   <p>Network cables are used to connect computers. The most commonly used cable is Category 5 cable RJ-45.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/network_cables.jpg" alt="Network Cables">
   <h2>Distributors</h2>
   <p>A computer can be connected to another one via a serial port but if we need to connect many computers to produce a network, this serial connection will not work.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/network_distributor.jpg" alt="Network Distributors">
   <p>The solution is to use a central body to which other computers, printers, scanners, etc. can be connected and then this body will manage or distribute network traffic.</p>
   <h2>Router</h2>
   <p>A router is a type of device which acts as the central point among computers and other devices that are a part of the network. It is equipped with holes called ports. Computers and other devices are connected to a router using network cables. Now-a-days router comes in wireless modes using which computers can be connected without any physical cable.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/network_router.jpg" alt="Network Router">
   <h2>Network Card</h2>
   <p>Network card is a necessary component of a computer without which a computer cannot be connected over a network. It is also known as the network adapter or Network Interface Card (NIC). Most branded computers have network card pre-installed. Network cards are of two types: Internal and External Network Cards.</p>
   <h3>Internal Network Cards</h3>
   <p>Motherboard has a slot for internal network card where it is to be inserted. Internal network cards are of two types in which the first type uses Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) connection, while the second type uses Industry Standard Architecture (ISA). Network cables are required to provide network access.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/network_card.jpg" alt="Network Card">
   <h3>External Network Cards</h3>
   <p>External network cards are of two types: Wireless and USB based. Wireless network card needs to be inserted into the motherboard, however no network cable is required to connect to the network.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/external_network_card.jpg" alt="External Network Card">
   <h2>Universal Serial Bus (USB)</h2>
   <p>USB card is easy to use and connects via USB port. Computers automatically detect USB card and can install the drivers required to support the USB network card automatically.</p>

   <p>In this chapter, we will see what is Internet and Intranet, as well as discuss the similarities and differences between the two.</p>
   <h2>Internet</h2>
   <p>It is a worldwide/global system of interconnected computer networks. It uses the standard Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Every computer in Internet is identified by a unique IP address. IP Address is a unique set of numbers (such as 110.22.33.114) which identifies a computer’s location.</p>
   <p>A special computer DNS (Domain Name Server) is used to provide a name to the IP Address so that the user can locate a computer by a name. For example, a DNS server will resolve a name <a target="_blank" rel="follow" href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com">https://www.tutorialspoint.com</a> to a particular IP address to uniquely identify the computer on which this website is hosted.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/internet.jpg" alt="Internet">
   <p>Internet is accessible to every user all over the world.</p>
   <h2>Intranet</h2>
   <p>Intranet is the system in which multiple PCs are connected to each other. PCs in intranet are not available to the world outside the intranet. Usually each organization has its own Intranet network and members/employees of that organization can access the computers in their intranet.</p>
   <img src="/computer_fundamentals/images/intranet.jpg" alt="Intranet">
   <p>Each computer in Intranet is also identified by an IP Address which is unique among the computers in that Intranet.</p>
   <h2>Similarities between Internet and Intranet</h2>
   <ul class="list">
   <li><p>Intranet uses the internet protocols such as TCP/IP and FTP.</p></li>
   <li><p>Intranet sites are accessible via the web browser in a similar way as websites in the internet. However, only members of Intranet network can access intranet hosted sites.</p></li>
   <li><p>In Intranet, own instant messengers can be used as similar to yahoo messenger/gtalk over the internet.</p></li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Differences between Internet and Intranet</h2>
   <ul class="list">
   <li><p>Internet is general to PCs all over the world whereas Intranet is specific to few PCs.</p></li>
   <li><p>Internet provides a wider and better access to websites to a large population, whereas Intranet is restricted.</p></li>
   <li><p>Internet is not as safe as Intranet. Intranet can be safely privatized as per the need.</p></li>

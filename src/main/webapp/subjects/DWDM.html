        <p>Data Warehousing schemas are structures that define how data is organized, stored, and accessed within a Data Warehouse. These schemas provide a blueprint for how data is structured to support analytical queries and reporting.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Common Types of Data Warehousing Schemas:</h2>
        <p>There are several common types of data warehousing schemas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Star Schema:</strong> In a Star Schema, data is organized into a central Fact Table, surrounded by Dimension Tables. This schema is ideal for query performance and is commonly used in data warehousing.</li>
            <li><strong>Snowflake Schema:</strong> A Snowflake Schema is a normalized version of the Star Schema. Dimension Tables in a Snowflake Schema are further divided into sub-dimensions, reducing redundancy but potentially increasing complexity.</li>
            <li><strong>Galaxy Schema:</strong> A Galaxy Schema is an extension of the Star Schema, where multiple Fact Tables are connected to Dimension Tables. It's suitable for complex analytical scenarios where multiple fact tables are involved.</li>
            <li><strong>Fact Constellation Schema:</strong> In a Fact Constellation Schema, multiple Fact Tables are linked to multiple Dimension Tables. This schema is used when there are multiple business processes or scenarios to analyze.</li>
            <li><strong>Snowball Schema:</strong> A Snowball Schema is a variation of the Snowflake Schema, where a Dimension Table is further divided into sub-dimensions, resulting in a highly normalized structure.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Choosing the Right Schema:</h2>
        <p>The choice of a data warehousing schema depends on the specific requirements of the business and the nature of the data. Star Schema is the most commonly used schema due to its simplicity and query performance benefits, but other schemas may be chosen for specific use cases.</p>

    <h1>Bubble Sort Algorithm</h1>
    
    <p>Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm used to arrange elements in a list or array in ascending or descending order. It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order until no swaps are needed. Bubble Sort is easy to understand but not very efficient, especially for large datasets.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are some key concepts related to the Bubble Sort algorithm:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Bubble Sort compares adjacent elements in the list and swaps them if they are out of order.</li>
        <li><strong>Pass:</strong> Each pass through the list compares and potentially swaps elements, with the largest (or smallest, depending on the sorting order) element "bubbling up" to its correct position.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Bubble Sort can be optimized by stopping early if no swaps are made during a pass, indicating that the list is already sorted.</li>
        <li><strong>Stable Sorting:</strong> Bubble Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Algorithm Steps</h2>
    <p>The Bubble Sort algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with the first element (index 0) of the list.</li>
        <li>Compare the current element with the next element (index 1).
            <ul>
                <li>If the current element is greater (for ascending order) or smaller (for descending order) than the next element, swap them.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Continue comparing and swapping adjacent elements as you move through the list, one element at a time.</li>
        <li>After each pass through the list, the largest (or smallest) element will "bubble up" to the end (or beginning) of the list.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 1-4 for a total of (n-1) passes, where 'n' is the number of elements in the list.</li>
        <li>If no swaps are made during a pass, the list is considered sorted, and the algorithm terminates early.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>Bubble Sort is mainly used for educational purposes and small datasets due to its simplicity. It is not commonly used in production code for large datasets. Nonetheless, it serves as a basic introduction to sorting algorithms and can be used in cases where simplicity is more important than efficiency.</p>

    <p>Other sorting algorithms, such as Quick Sort and Merge Sort, are typically preferred for larger datasets or when performance is critical.</p>

    <h1>Bucket Sort Algorithm</h1>
    
    <p>Bucket Sort is a sorting algorithm that divides the input data into a fixed number of buckets or bins. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using another sorting algorithm or recursively applying Bucket Sort. Finally, the sorted buckets are concatenated to produce the sorted output.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are some key concepts related to the Bucket Sort algorithm:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Buckets:</strong> Bucket Sort divides the input data into a fixed number of buckets, each of which can hold a range of values.</li>
        <li><strong>Range Mapping:</strong> Values from the input data are mapped to specific buckets based on their range or distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Bucket Sorting:</strong> Each bucket is sorted individually using a sorting algorithm (e.g., insertion sort or quicksort).</li>
        <li><strong>Concatenation:</strong> Finally, the sorted buckets are concatenated to produce the sorted output.</li>
        <li><strong>Stable Sorting:</strong> Bucket Sort can be stable, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements within a bucket.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Algorithm Steps</h2>
    <p>The Bucket Sort algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create an array of empty buckets, each representing a specific range or distribution of values.</li>
        <li>Iterate through the input data and place each element into the appropriate bucket based on its value and the range mapping.</li>
        <li>Sort each individual bucket using a sorting algorithm (e.g., insertion sort or quicksort).</li>
        <li>Concatenate the sorted buckets to produce the final sorted output.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>Bucket Sort is useful when the input data is uniformly distributed across a range and fits within the available memory. Some applications and use cases of Bucket Sort include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorting floating-point numbers within a specific range.</li>
        <li>Sorting data with a known distribution, such as grades or test scores.</li>
        <li>Radix Sort: A variation of Bucket Sort used for sorting integers and strings with multiple digits or characters.</li>
        <li>Parallel Computing: Bucket Sort can be parallelized for efficient sorting on multiple processors.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bucket Sort offers linear time complexity when the input data is uniformly distributed, making it a suitable choice for specific scenarios where its assumptions are met.</p>

    <h1>Heap Sort Algorithm</h1>
    
    <p>Heap Sort is an efficient, in-place, and comparison-based sorting algorithm that leverages the properties of a binary heap data structure. It works by transforming the input array into a max-heap, repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap, and placing it at the end of the array. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are some key concepts related to the Heap Sort algorithm:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Max Heap:</strong> Heap Sort operates on a max heap data structure, where the parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes (for a max-heap).</li>
        <li><strong>Heapify:</strong> The process of converting an array into a max heap is called heapify. It involves rearranging the elements to satisfy the max heap property.</li>
        <li><strong>Sorting:</strong> After heapify, Heap Sort repeatedly extracts the maximum element (the root of the heap) and places it at the end of the array. The heap size is reduced, and the process continues until the entire array is sorted.</li>
        <li><strong>In-Place Sorting:</strong> Heap Sort sorts the array in-place, meaning it does not require additional memory for temporary storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Algorithm Steps</h2>
    <p>The Heap Sort algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Build a max heap from the input array by heapifying it. This creates a heap where the largest element (the root) is at the top.</li>
        <li>Swap the root element (the maximum) with the last element in the array and reduce the heap size by one.</li>
        <li>Heapify the remaining heap to maintain the max heap property.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the entire array is sorted.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>Heap Sort is used in various applications and scenarios where a stable and efficient sorting algorithm is required. Some of its applications include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorting large datasets efficiently.</li>
        <li>Priority Queue: Heap Sort is the basis for many priority queue implementations.</li>
        <li>Operating Systems: Heap Sort can be used for process scheduling and memory management.</li>
        <li>Selection Algorithms: It can be used as a building block for selection algorithms like the median of medians.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Heap Sort is known for its reliable performance and is often preferred when a stable and efficient sorting algorithm is needed, especially for large datasets.</p>

    <h1>Merge Sort Algorithm</h1>
    
    <p>Merge Sort is a highly efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by dividing an unsorted array into two halves, recursively sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves to produce a single sorted array. Merge Sort is known for its predictable performance and is often used for sorting large datasets.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are some key concepts related to the Merge Sort algorithm:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Merge Sort follows a divide-and-conquer strategy, breaking the sorting problem into smaller subproblems.</li>
        <li><strong>Splitting:</strong> The array is repeatedly divided into two halves until individual elements are reached, creating a binary tree structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Merging:</strong> Sorted subarrays are merged back together into larger and larger sorted arrays until the entire array is sorted.</li>
        <li><strong>Stable Sorting:</strong> Merge Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements.</li>
        <li><strong>In-Place Merge:</strong> A variation of Merge Sort called "In-Place Merge Sort" minimizes the use of additional memory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Algorithm Steps</h2>
    <p>The Merge Sort algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide the unsorted array into two halves, a left half and a right half, at the midpoint.</li>
        <li>Recursively apply Merge Sort to each of the two halves until they become single-element arrays (base case).</li>
        <li>Merge the two sorted halves back together to create a single sorted array:
            <ul>
                <li>Compare the elements of the left and right halves, taking the smaller element first and moving it to the merged array.</li>
                <li>Repeat the comparison and merging process until both halves are exhausted.</li>
                <li>If one half has remaining elements, add them to the merged array.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The merged array is now a sorted version of the original unsorted array.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>Merge Sort is widely used in various applications and scenarios where stable and efficient sorting is required. Some of its applications include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorting large datasets efficiently, especially when additional memory usage is not a concern.</li>
        <li>External Sorting: Sorting data that does not fit entirely in memory by using an external memory version of Merge Sort.</li>
        <li>Parallel Computing: Merge Sort can be parallelized to sort data on multiple processors or threads.</li>
        <li>Database Management: Used for sorting and merging data in databases and during query processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Merge Sort's reliable and consistent performance makes it a valuable tool in various fields of computer science and data processing.</p>

    <h1>Quick Sort Algorithm</h1>
    
    <p>Quick Sort is a highly efficient, in-place, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the input array and partitioning the other elements into two subarrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The subarrays are then recursively sorted. Quick Sort is known for its speed and is often used for sorting large datasets.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are some key concepts related to the Quick Sort algorithm:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pivot Element:</strong> Quick Sort selects a pivot element from the array to divide it into two subarrays.</li>
        <li><strong>Partitioning:</strong> Elements are partitioned into two subarrays: one containing elements less than the pivot and the other containing elements greater than the pivot.</li>
        <li><strong>Recursion:</strong> After partitioning, Quick Sort is applied recursively to the two subarrays.</li>
        <li><strong>In-Place Sorting:</strong> Quick Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it sorts the array without requiring additional memory for temporary storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Randomized Pivot Selection:</strong> To improve performance and avoid worst-case scenarios, some implementations use a randomized approach to select the pivot.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Algorithm Steps</h2>
    <p>The Quick Sort algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Choose a pivot element from the array. Various strategies for selecting the pivot can be used.</li>
        <li>Partition the array into two subarrays:
            <ul>
                <li>Elements less than the pivot go into one subarray.</li>
                <li>Elements greater than the pivot go into another subarray.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Recursively apply Quick Sort to the subarrays created in step 2.</li>
        <li>Combine the sorted subarrays and the pivot element to produce the final sorted array.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>Quick Sort is widely used in various applications and scenarios where efficient sorting is required. Some of its applications include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorting large datasets efficiently, making it suitable for various data processing tasks.</li>
        <li>Programming languages and libraries often use Quick Sort as their default sorting algorithm.</li>
        <li>File systems and databases use Quick Sort for sorting data records.</li>
        <li>Computer science and algorithm courses use Quick Sort as a classic example of a divide-and-conquer algorithm.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Quick Sort's speed and efficiency make it a popular choice for sorting, especially for datasets with a large number of elements.</p>

    <h1>Radix Sort Algorithm</h1>
    
    <p>Radix Sort is a non-comparative, stable sorting algorithm that works by sorting elements based on their individual digits or characters. It processes the elements from the least significant digit (LSB) to the most significant digit (MSB) or from the rightmost character to the leftmost character, using a counting or bucket sort as a subroutine. Radix Sort is often used for sorting strings, integers, and other data with multiple digits or characters.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are some key concepts related to the Radix Sort algorithm:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Digit Sorting:</strong> Radix Sort sorts elements based on individual digits or characters, starting from the rightmost and moving towards the leftmost digit or character.</li>
        <li><strong>Least Significant Digit (LSB):</strong> The first pass of Radix Sort sorts elements based on the least significant digit.</li>
        <li><strong>Most Significant Digit (MSB):</strong> The last pass of Radix Sort sorts elements based on the most significant digit.</li>
        <li><strong>Counting or Bucket Sort:</strong> Radix Sort uses a stable sorting algorithm (such as counting sort or bucket sort) as a subroutine to sort elements at each digit position.</li>
        <li><strong>Stable Sorting:</strong> Radix Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Algorithm Steps</h2>
    <p>The Radix Sort algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Identify the maximum number of digits (or characters) among all elements in the array. This determines the number of passes required.</li>
        <li>Start with the rightmost digit (LSB) and proceed towards the leftmost digit (MSB) in each pass.</li>
        <li>For each pass, use a stable sorting algorithm (e.g., counting sort or bucket sort) to sort elements based on the digit at the current position.</li>
        <li>Repeat the above steps for each digit position, moving from LSB to MSB.</li>
        <li>After the final pass, the array is sorted.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>Radix Sort is used in various applications and scenarios where stable and efficient sorting of data with multiple digits or characters is required. Some of its applications include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorting strings and integers with multiple digits or characters.</li>
        <li>Sorting records or data structures based on composite keys.</li>
        <li>Text processing and dictionary-based operations.</li>
        <li>Computer graphics and image processing for sorting colors or pixels.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Radix Sort is particularly useful when sorting data with a fixed width (e.g., integers) or when the range of values is known to be limited.</p>

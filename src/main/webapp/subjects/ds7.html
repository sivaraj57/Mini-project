    <h1>Graph Data Structure</h1>
    
    <p>A graph is a mathematical and data structure concept used to represent a collection of objects and the relationships or connections between them. Graphs are versatile and can model a wide range of real-world scenarios, making them a fundamental concept in computer science and various other fields.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are some key concepts related to graphs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Node (Vertex):</strong> Each element in a graph is called a node or vertex. Nodes represent objects, entities, or data points.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge:</strong> An edge is a connection or relationship between two nodes in a graph. Edges can be directed (have a specific direction) or undirected (bidirectional).</li>
        <li><strong>Graph Type:</strong> Graphs can be categorized into various types, including directed graphs (digraphs), undirected graphs, weighted graphs, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjacency:</strong> The adjacency of nodes refers to whether or not two nodes are connected by an edge.</li>
        <li><strong>Path:</strong> A path in a graph is a sequence of nodes in which each adjacent pair is connected by an edge.</li>
        <li><strong>Cycle:</strong> A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node, forming a closed loop within the graph.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Representation</h2>
    <p>Graphs can be represented in various ways, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adjacency Matrix:</strong> A 2D matrix where each cell represents whether there is an edge between two nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjacency List:</strong> A collection of lists or arrays, where each list corresponds to a node and contains its adjacent nodes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Graphs</h2>
    <p>There are several types of graphs, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Directed Graph (Digraph):</strong> A graph in which edges have a direction from one node to another.</li>
        <li><strong>Undirected Graph:</strong> A graph in which edges have no direction, and connections between nodes are bidirectional.</li>
        <li><strong>Weighted Graph:</strong> A graph in which each edge has a weight or cost associated with it.</li>
        <li><strong>Cyclic Graph:</strong> A graph that contains at least one cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Acyclic Graph:</strong> A graph that does not contain any cycles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Operations</h2>
    <p>Common operations and algorithms related to graphs include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Traversal:</strong> Visiting all nodes and edges in a graph, typically using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).</li>
        <li><strong>Shortest Path:</strong> Finding the shortest path between two nodes, often using algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman-Ford algorithm.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum Spanning Tree:</strong> Finding a subset of edges that forms a tree covering all nodes with the minimum possible total edge weight, often using algorithms like Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>Graphs are used in various applications, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Networks: Modeling computer networks, social networks, and transportation networks.</li>
        <li>Recommendation Systems: Analyzing user preferences and making recommendations based on connections and interactions.</li>

    <h1>Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm</h1>
    
    <p>Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore and search for nodes or vertices in a graph. It operates in a breadthward motion and systematically explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level. BFS is widely used for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs and for exploring networks and hierarchical structures.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are some key concepts related to the BFS algorithm:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Queue:</strong> BFS uses a queue data structure to maintain the order in which nodes are visited. Nodes are added to the queue for exploration and removed from the front of the queue when they are visited.</li>
        <li><strong>Starting Node:</strong> BFS begins its traversal from a specified starting node or vertex.</li>
        <li><strong>Visited Nodes:</strong> To avoid visiting the same node multiple times and to prevent infinite loops, BFS keeps track of visited nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Neighbor Nodes:</strong> BFS explores the neighbor nodes of the current node before moving to the next level.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Algorithm Steps</h2>
    <p>The BFS algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start from the initial node and mark it as visited.</li>
        <li>Add the initial node to the queue.</li>
        <li>While the queue is not empty:
            <ol>
                <li>Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.</li>
                <li>Process the node (e.g., print its value).</li>
                <li>Enqueue all unvisited neighbor nodes of the current node.</li>
                <li>Mark the visited neighbor nodes as visited.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>BFS is used in various applications, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shortest Path: Finding the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.</li>
        <li>Network Routing: Exploring computer networks and finding the optimal routes.</li>
        <li>Web Crawling: Indexing and exploring websites on the internet.</li>
        <li>Game Development: Pathfinding in video games.</li>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence: Solving problems in AI and robotics, such as navigating a robot in an unknown environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The BFS algorithm is a fundamental tool for exploring and searching graphs and networks efficiently, making it a key component in various computer science and real-world applications.</p>

    <h1>Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm</h1>
    
    <p>Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore and search for nodes or vertices in a graph. It operates in a depthward motion, moving as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. DFS is often used for tasks like finding paths, cycles, and connected components in graphs.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are some key concepts related to the DFS algorithm:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stack:</strong> DFS uses a stack data structure to maintain the order of nodes to be visited. Nodes are pushed onto the stack for exploration and popped off the stack when they are visited.</li>
        <li><strong>Starting Node:</strong> DFS begins its traversal from a specified starting node or vertex.</li>
        <li><strong>Visited Nodes:</strong> To avoid revisiting the same node and to prevent infinite loops, DFS keeps track of visited nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Neighbor Nodes:</strong> DFS explores neighbor nodes of the current node until there are no unvisited neighbors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Algorithm Steps</h2>
    <p>The DFS algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start from the initial node and mark it as visited.</li>
        <li>Push the initial node onto the stack.</li>
        <li>While the stack is not empty:
            <ol>
                <li>Pop a node from the top of the stack.</li>
                <li>Process the node (e.g., print its value).</li>
                <li>Push all unvisited neighbor nodes of the current node onto the stack.</li>
                <li>Mark the visited neighbor nodes as visited.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>DFS is used in various applications, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pathfinding: Finding paths in mazes, game maps, and routing problems.</li>
        <li>Connected Components: Determining connected components in a graph.</li>

    <h1>Working with Files in Java</h1>
    
    <p>
        Java provides comprehensive libraries for performing file-related operations, allowing you to read, write, manipulate, and manage files and directories. Whether you need to create, read, or modify files, Java offers a range of classes and methods to handle various file-related tasks.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>File Class:</strong> The <code>java.io.File</code> class represents a file or directory path in the file system. It provides methods for creating, deleting, checking the existence of, and navigating files and directories.</li>
        <li><strong>File I/O:</strong> Java supports both character-based and byte-based input and output streams for reading and writing data to files. Classes like <code>FileInputStream</code>, <code>FileOutputStream</code>, <code>FileReader</code>, and <code>FileWriter</code> are commonly used for this purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Buffered I/O:</strong> Buffered I/O classes such as <code>BufferedReader</code> and <code>BufferedWriter</code> offer improved performance by reading or writing data in larger chunks, reducing disk access.</li>
        <li><strong>Directory Operations:</strong> Java provides methods for listing the contents of directories, creating directories, deleting directories, and navigating through directory structures using the <code>File</code> class.</li>
        <li><strong>NIO (New I/O):</strong> The <code>java.nio</code> package introduces a more flexible and efficient I/O framework with features like memory-mapped files and non-blocking I/O for advanced file operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Exception Handling:</strong> When working with files, it's essential to handle exceptions like <code>IOException</code> to deal with potential errors during file operations.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>
        Here are some simple examples demonstrating common file operations in Java:
    </p>
    
    <h3>Reading Text from a File</h3>
    <pre>
        <code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ReadFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example.txt"))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"))) {
            writer.write("Hello, World!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
        </code>
    </pre>
    
    <h3>Listing Files in a Directory</h3>
    <pre>
        <code>
import java.io.File;

public class ListFilesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File directory = new File("my_directory");
        File[] files = directory.listFiles();
        if (files != null) {
            for (File file : files) {
                System.out.println(file.getName());
            }
        }
    }
}
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        These examples showcase some of the basic file operations you can perform in Java. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to explore more advanced file handling techniques and libraries.

    <h1>Create and Write Files in Java</h1>
    
    <p>
        Java provides a robust set of libraries for creating and writing files. Whether you need to create a new file or append data to an existing one, Java offers a range of classes and methods to handle these file-related tasks efficiently.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>File Class:</strong> The <code>java.io.File</code> class represents a file or directory path in the file system. You can use this class to create new files, check file existence, and specify file paths.</li>
        <li><strong>FileWriter and BufferedWriter:</strong> The <code>FileWriter</code> and <code>BufferedWriter</code> classes are used for writing text data to files. They provide methods for opening files, writing data, and closing files.</li>
        <li><strong>IOException Handling:</strong> When working with files, it's essential to handle exceptions like <code>IOException</code> to deal with potential errors during file creation and writing.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    
    <h3>Create a New File and Write Data</h3>
    <pre>
        <code>
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class CreateAndWriteFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String fileName = "example.txt";
        String content = "This is some text that we want to write to a file.";

        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(fileName))) {
            writer.write(content);
            System.out.println("File created and data written successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this example, we create a new file named "example.txt" and write the specified content to it using a <code>BufferedWriter</code>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Append Data to an Existing File</h3>
    <pre>
        <code>
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class AppendToFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String fileName = "example.txt";
        String content = "This is additional data appended to the file.";

        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(fileName, true))) {
            writer.newLine(); // Move to the next line
            writer.write(content);
            System.out.println("Data appended to the file successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this example, we open an existing file ("example.txt") and append the specified content to it by setting the <code>append</code> parameter of the <code>FileWriter</code> constructor to <code>true</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        These examples demonstrate the basic process of creating and writing files in Java. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to explore more advanced file handling techniques and libraries.

        <li><strong>IOException Handling:</strong> It's essential to handle exceptions like <code>IOException</code> to deal with potential errors during file reading.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    
    <h3>Read Text from a File Line by Line</h3>
    <pre>
        <code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ReadFileLineByLine {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String fileName = "example.txt";

        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        try (BufferedInputStream inputStream = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(fileName))) {
            int data;
            while ((data = inputStream.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print(data + " ");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this example, we open the binary file "example.bin" and read its contents as individual bytes using a <code>BufferedInputStream</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        These examples demonstrate the basic process of reading files in Java. Depending on your specific use case and the type of data you need to read, you may need to explore more advanced file handling techniques and libraries.

    <h1>Delete Files in Java</h1>
    
    <p>
        Deleting files is a common operation in Java programming, especially when managing temporary files or cleaning up resources. Java provides classes and methods to delete files and directories from the file system.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>File Class:</strong> The <code>java.io.File</code> class represents a file or directory path in the file system. You can use this class to specify the file or directory to be deleted.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion Methods:</strong> Java provides methods such as <code>delete()</code> for deleting files and <code>deleteOnExit()</code> for scheduling files for deletion when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) exits.</li>
        <li><strong>Directory Deletion:</strong> To delete directories and their contents, you may need to use recursive techniques to traverse subdirectories and delete files and directories recursively.</li>
        <li><strong>Exception Handling:</strong> It's essential to handle exceptions like <code>SecurityException</code> and <code>IOException</code> when deleting files and directories to handle potential errors.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    
    <h3>Delete a File</h3>
    <pre>
        <code>
import java.io.File;

public class DeleteFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String fileName = "example.txt";
        File fileToDelete = new File(fileName);

        if (fileToDelete.delete()) {
            System.out.println("File deleted successfully.");
        } else {
            System.err.println("Failed to delete the file.");
        }
    }
}
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this example, we specify the file "example.txt" to be deleted using the <code>delete()</code> method of the <code>File</code> class.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Delete a Directory and Its Contents</h3>
    <pre>
        <code>
import java.io.File;

public class DeleteDirectoryExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String directoryName = "my_directory";
        File directoryToDelete = new File(directoryName);

        if (deleteDirectory(directoryToDelete)) {
            System.out.println("Directory and its contents deleted successfully.");
        } else {
            System.err.println("Failed to delete the directory.");
        }
    }

    private static boolean deleteDirectory(File directory) {
        if (directory.isDirectory()) {
            File[] files = directory.listFiles();
            if (files != null) {
                for (File file : files) {
                    if (!deleteDirectory(file)) {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return directory.delete();
    }
}
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this example, we delete a directory named "my_directory" and its contents using a recursive approach to delete files and subdirectories.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        These examples demonstrate the basic process of deleting files and directories in Java. Depending on your specific use case and requirements, you may need to explore more advanced file handling techniques and libraries.

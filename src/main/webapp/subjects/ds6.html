    <h1>Tree Data Structure</h1>
    
    <p>A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is a widely used data structure in computer science and has many applications in various domains.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are some key concepts related to tree data structures:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Node:</strong> Each element in a tree is called a node. Nodes contain data and may have zero or more child nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge:</strong> An edge is a connection between two nodes in a tree.</li>
        <li><strong>Root:</strong> The topmost node in a tree is called the root. It serves as the starting point for traversing the tree.</li>
        <li><strong>Parent:</strong> A node in a tree can have child nodes. The node from which an edge originates is called the parent of the child node.</li>
        <li><strong>Child:</strong> Nodes that are connected to a parent node are called its children.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaf:</strong> A node that has no children is called a leaf node.</li>
        <li><strong>Depth:</strong> The depth of a node in a tree is the length of the path from the root to that node.</li>
        <li><strong>Height:</strong> The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node. It represents the maximum depth of the tree.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Trees</h2>
    <p>There are various types of trees, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Some common types of trees include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Binary Tree:</strong> A tree in which each node has at most two children, typically referred to as the left child and the right child.</li>
        <li><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST):</strong> A binary tree where the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains nodes with values greater than the node's value.</li>
        <li><strong>AVL Tree:</strong> A self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.</li>
        <li><strong>Heap:</strong> A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, often used for priority queue operations.</li>
        <li><strong>General Tree:</strong> A tree in which a node can have any number of children. There is no restriction on the number of children each node can have.</li>
        <li><strong>N-ary Tree:</strong> A tree in which each node can have up to 'n' children.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Operations</h2>
    <p>Common operations performed on trees include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Traversal:</strong> Visiting all nodes in a tree in a specific order, such as in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal.</li>
        <li><strong>Insertion:</strong> Adding a new node to the tree.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Removing a node from the tree.</li>
        <li><strong>Searching:</strong> Finding a node with a specific value in the tree.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>Trees are used in various applications, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Binary search trees for efficient searching and sorting.</li>
        <li>File system directory structures.</li>
        <li>Representing hierarchical data like organization charts.</li>
